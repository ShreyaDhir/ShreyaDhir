I am Shreya and I'm a sophomore at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneshwar. Currently my concentration is Computer Science and I'm passionate about learning new stuff! 👨‍💻 I started coding in 2020 and after spending countless hours researching about different domains and fields in Computer Science I fell in love with ReactJS and Machine Learning. ❤️ I want to devote as much time as I can to coding and want to grow with this progressive community.
